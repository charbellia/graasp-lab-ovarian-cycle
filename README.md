# Graasp Lab Ovarian Cycle

The lab allows the learner to  interact on ovarian hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) and pituitary (FSH and LH) to understand how these hormones control the ovarian cycle and how they ensure ovulation.

This Lab was created using [Graasp App Starter React](https://github.com/react-epfl/graasp-app-starter-react)
